    Functionality for the Potion programming language.
    Includes syntax highlighting, code folding, and more!


## Syntax highlighting

This plugin with automatically provide syntax highlighting for
Potion files (files ending in .pn).

## Folding

Use the folding commands that you already love, with Potion files as well.
Check `:h fold-commands` for more information.

## Mappings

The plugin features mappings for:

* Compile and run the file 
* Show byte code
* Moving by section on the file

### External commands

| Default key | Description | Help-tag |
| `<localleader>r` | Compile and run the current Potion file.| `Potion-localleader_r` |
| `<localleader>b` | View the bytecode it generates as it compiles.| `Potion-localleader_b` |

If you want, you can customize you localleader key by adding something like
this to your vimrc:


    let g:potion_localleader = "<space>"

Now the space bar will be the local leader.

### Section movements

| Default key | Description | Help-tag |
| `]]` | Move to the next section | PotionNextSection |
| `[[` | Move to the previous section | `PotionPreviousSection` |
| `][` | Move to the next function | `PotionNextFunction` |
| `[]` | Move to the previous function | `PotionPreviousFunction` |
